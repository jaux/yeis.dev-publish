      <description>March 7th, 2019.
I need to mark this date because on that day I decided to seriously learn Emacs and switch to it as my primary text editor after my 12 years Vim journey.
Why? Because currently I am working on the new design of Gemsby and I have chosen to use TypeScript for the work. Unfortunately, TypeScript support in Vim is very weak at this moment, I need to spend a lot of time to fight my text editor which I would rather not to do.</description>

      <description>Google opened its .dev domains for anyone to purchase without the early access fee a few days ago. Every developer should grab a .dev domain to showcase their great creations and works in my opinion, so I have grabbed TWO for myself üòÅ.
I will need some time to figure out a better use of those domains, but for the time being, my shiny new domains, yeliu.dev and liuye.dev, will be redirect to here.</description>
