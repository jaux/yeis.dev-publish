      <description>March 7th, 2019.
I need to mark this date because on that day I decided to seriously learn Emacs and switch to it as my primary text editor after my 12 years Vim journey.
Why? Because currently I am working on the new design of Gemsby and I have chosen to use TypeScript for the work. Unfortunately, TypeScript support in Vim is very weak at this moment, I need to spend a lot of time to fight my text editor which I would rather not to do.</description>
